## Hey there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Lukas

I'm a student at Kaunas University of Technology focused on learning PC and VR game development. Here you can find the main projects I am currently working on.

### [Forest master](https://github.com/LukasVasi/forest-master)

A standalone VR game intended to help you develop your attention skills created using the Godot engine.

### Project boost

Learn by making the same game with different engines - that's the idea behind Project Boost. Based on [GameDev.tv's](https://www.gamedev.tv/) Unity and Godot courses' tutorial of the same name it is a game were you control a rocket in an attempt to get it through levels filled with obstacles.
