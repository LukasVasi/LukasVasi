## Hey there 👋, I'm Lukas

I'm an aspiring software developer constantly exploring a wide range of avenues to develop my skills. Here you can explore all the diverse projects I have worked on.

### [Blog](https://github.com/LukasVasi/blog)

A Blog website built with ASP.NET MVC. A simple project started during one of my interships that I use to develop my skills of writing clean code, applying clean architecture principles and getting more familiar with the best practices of .NET back-end development.

### [Forest master](https://github.com/LukasVasi/forest-master)

A VR game intended to help you develop your attention skills. Created using the Godot engine for Meta Quest headsets.
